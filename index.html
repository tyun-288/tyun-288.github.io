            <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>A second-year Integrated Engineering student at the University of British Columbia with a strong interest in Software Engineering. Passionate about tackling complex technical challenges, I have hands-on experience with programming, design, and hardware integration. Despite never studying abroad before university, I took on the challenge of moving to Canada, demonstrating adaptability, resilience, and strong communication skills. Over the past year, I translated theoretical knowledge into practical expertise through two major projects. While I recognize that my engineering skills are still developing, I am eager to grow, contribute, and apply my problem-solving mindset in real-world scenarios.</p>
